# Credit-Card-Fraud-by-Machine-Learning

The Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection.ipynb notebook uses machine learning to identify fraudulent transactions in credit card data. It includes data preprocessing, under sampling, exploratory data analysis, and model training using algorithms like Logistic Regression. Evaluation metrics such as Accuracy Score assess the models' performance in detecting fraud accurately.
